********************************** Who ever clone this application, please maintain below ****************************
I would suggest you to create a new application as its a single view controller and rewrite with latest features.

1. Analyse the methods
2. List down the tasks to be done.
3. Nothing new to be done.
4. Goal is to use the latest classes or remove the deprecated methods.
5. Create a new application in XCode 11.0 as we have lastest lifecycle methods to consume.
6. Based on the analysis of existing application(point 1), try to do it MVVM or MVC as per your wish. Like maintain Model, ViewModel, Controller
7. We have used AdMobs also( I think its from firebase). Probably we many need to see that also.
8. I would be great if you can add any new feature which you like..Like animations or any transitions..
